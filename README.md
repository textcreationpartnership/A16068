      * ¶All this is taken out of the long ſtudie, and diuers experiences,
that a gentleman made, by the ſpace of many yeres, in the ſeruice of
a noble Ladie. Beyng a thyng moſte certain, that an old man, of thre
skore and ten yeres, all withered withage, of a verie euill complexion,
and ſubiect to diuers kindes of diſeaſes, was altered and chaunged,
as into the age of ſxe oir eight and thirtie yeres.

      * ¶To make a precious licoure, and of ineſtimable vertue: the
whiche taken at the mouthe, ſtrengtheneth and augmenteth the naturall
heate, and radicall humidite purifieth the blood, and clenſeth
the ſtomacke from all ſuperfluitie of humours: and by that meane
conſerueth the health and yougth, and prolongeth the life of hym
that vſeth it.

      * ¶A potion or drinke, to be vſed in ſteade of Sirop, good for men of
al ages and complexiōs, that will be purged the whiche, taken what
daie you will, driueth a waie the euill humours, without mouyng or
troublyng the good, or doing any burte: And is alſo very good for the
great Pockes, and all infinnities, as well of the stomacke, as of the
heade: and is like wiſe profitable for them that be in health, to take
twiſe in the yere, in ſteade of an ordinary purgation, that is to ſaie,
in the Spryng tyme, and in September.

      * ¶A verie eaſie and good remedie, for to heale all maner of Pockes,
whiche is made with litle coſt, and requireth not that a manne
kepe his bedde or his houſe, but maie vſe it going in the ſtreetes: And
it is alſo verie good for all ſortes of grief in the iointes, in what part
of the bodie ſo euer it be.

      * ¶To diſſolue and reducte gold into a potable licoure, whiche conſerueth
the youth and health of a manne, as well taken by it ſelf, as
mingled with the foreſaied licoure, ſpoken of in the ſecond Chapiter
of this preſente booke, and will heale euery diſeaſe that is thought
curable, in the ſpace of ſeuen daies at the furtheſt.

      * ¶To heale an excreſcens or growyng vp of the fleſhe, within
the yarde of a man, albeit it were rooted in of a long tyme.

      * To heale all maner of inflamatiō and euill diſpoſition of the
liuer, and by this ſame ſecrete haue been healed certain perſones,
whiche had their faces as it were Leparie, greate ſwollen
legges, their handes inflambed, and rough within ſide.

      * To heale the Emorhodes or Piles in a nighte, a rare
ſecrete and verie excellente.

      * A perfecte and proued remedie for them that bee weake
of ſtomacke, and can not keepe their meate, without vomityng
it vp again.

      * An excellente remedie, wherewith a woman of .xxxvi.
yeres was healed, that had ſo marred her ſtomacke, that in
the ſpace of twoo yeres and an balfe, ſhe was neuer naturally
purged douneward: and as ſone as ſhe had eatē any thing,
ſhe vomited it vp againe, ſo that ſhe became yelowe, and as
drie as a ſticke.

litle children.
